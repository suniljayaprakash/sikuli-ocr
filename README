 * Description : Sikuli is a wonderful tool for automating workflows.
 * Sikuli now has OCR functionalities and uses tesseract in the backend.
 * For more Info on Sikuli kindly refer to http://sikuli.org
 * 
 * Problem Background : Sikuli has concept of Region, Pattern, Screen and Match.
 * However, its not possible to create a Virtual Region for an image stored 
 * in file system. It always creates a Region using "Current Screen Co-ordinates".
 * 
 * I wanted to extract text from image stored in file system. It was not possible
 * using the sikuli script. However, I wrote a Java program that uses
 * Sikuli jars and achieve the functionality.
